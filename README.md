### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to visit my profile!

- You can find my contact information at the left side of this page.
- I'm an Arch Linux user, still learning new things...
- You can use Chinese and English to contact with me, and English is **not** my native language.
- Currentlly I haven't created any "large" projects,
  and I'm still learing and trying to cooperate with some opensource projects,
  and try myself to do contribution.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to visit my profile!

- You can find my contact information at the left side of this page.
- I'm an Arch Linux user, still learning new things...
- Programming languages I like: C, JavaScript, Java, 
  and I also have some interest in OpenGL (Render stuff).
- You can use Chinese and English to contact with me, and English is **not** my native language.
- If you are interested about me, you can visit my [Blog](https://blog.starry-s.moe).
  (Written in Simplified Chinese)
- Currentlly I haven't created any "large" projects, 
  and I'm still learing and trying to cooperate with some opensource projects, 
  and try myself to do contribution.
